These are some of the first photographs I ever took. I was about 10 years old and saw this light from my window, how quickly it was changing, and wanted to remember it. I ran outside with my camera and wasn’t sure whether to photograph the tree with the sun hidden behind it or bursting out from its side.  I did both, realizing in that moment that the memory of the light could be both things.  I was excited - about the ability to freeze time and because it was up to me, where to put the sun.  

The desire to remember is rooted in my family; a warm, large group of storytellers, always recording, recalling, warning, celebrating. As a child I listened to their repetitive, meandering tales which felt distant.  But they were punctuated with fits of laughter which was fun. When these people, with their endless stories and German accents, all laughed together we were connected. My grandmother’s family were immigrants and refugees. Their stories mapped identity and home, having lost one because of the other. Their cartography continues here.

My grandmother created a chaotic archive of her life in letters, photographs, ephemera and mementos. A compelling story emerged from it, and conversations I recorded with her.  At first I imagined a short film and then, as it sprawled, a feature length documentary.  But, legible Documentaries demand narrative arcs, coherent storylines, order and endings - everything that Archives resist.  After years of failed attempts to navigate that tension in a conventional film, I chose this space. To make room for disorder and nuance, chance and uncertainty: a place for the endless.

So, instead of an archive shaped into a documentary, you will see the pieces of a documentary, folded into an archive, mingling with the evidence of my grandmother’s life.  You will find stories here if you want them, formed through your navigation. But if you’re just looking for an old family recipe for German Marble Cake, that’s here too.
